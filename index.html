  <p>This game is to be played by two players or teams with an equal number of people</br>
  For every else, ther're multiple versions possible.</br> The most common one is explained below.</br>
  The first pick is random (rolled out by Team-leader),</br> from the 2nd ongoing it's one pick Team 0, next pick Team 1 and so on.</br>
  If one team can't answer right, the other get a shot at it.</br> As soon as the game-master logs in the question in for the according team,</br>
  you'll get points worth the value of your question added to your score.</br>
  But there is one limitation, so you're only allowed to pick questions </br>from whatever category you prefer, within the bracker of 100 or 200 of value</br>
  as soon as there're no more questions to this restriction left,</br> you're free to pick from the 300-500 bracket.</br></br>
  After winning, you can claim your reward!</br> Good luck everyone!</p></div>
